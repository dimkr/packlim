Overview
========

packlim is a small, lightweight, hackable and permissively-licensed package
manager for Linux (https://www.kernel.org/) distributions.

packlim's performance-critical parts are written in C and the rest (mostly
logic and I/O) in written in Tcl, using Jim (http://jim.tcl.tk/). Native code
provides speed and parallelism, while exceptions and garbage collection improve
error handling and resource efficiency. Also, the use of a scripting language
greatly reduces the amount of code.

packlim is the successor to packlad (https://github.com/dimkr/packlad), which
tries to achieve the same goals using C code alone.

Features
========

  - Fast, recursive dependencies resolution
  - Parallel download of each dependency chain, before it gets installed
  - Package removal, with automatic cleanup of unneeded packages
  - Support for digitally-signed packages, with quick verification
  - Support for multiple compression algorithms
  - Support for installing packages to a prefix other than /
  - A scripting interface

Scripting Interface
===================

packlim allows complex package management tasks, using a Tcl API in the
"packlim" namespace. In addition, it wraps the libraries it depends on with Tcl
commands.

For example:
  1) To list the packages available in a repository:
    puts [packlim::available http://repository ""]

  2) To remove a package:
    packlim::remove ca-certificates [packlim::installed]

  3) To list the files contained in a tar archive:
    tar.list /path/to/tar

  4) To download a file:
    curl get http://some/file /some/path

  5) To remove all unneeded dependency packages:
    packlim::cleanup

packlim uses all API internally as well; see its implementation for more usage
examples.

Missing Features
================

  - Support for multiple repositories - packlim is designed for small
    distributions with one repository per architecture
  - Support for multiple architectures in one repository
